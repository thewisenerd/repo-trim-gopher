-b: mirror base URL
-n: number of versions to keep

why
---

maven takes a _lot_ of time for dependency resolution if a large number of
versions exist in a bunch of groupId:artifactId; so, mitm the mirror and
return only the last `n` versions;

ideal solution? get a proper repository manager and clean by unused x days.
